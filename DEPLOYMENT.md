## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Deployment Issues
- Check the build logs in your hosting platform
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify the build command is correct

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors:**
- Make sure all imports are correct
- Check file paths are case-sensitive

**"Build failed" on Vercel:**
- Check the build logs
- Ensure `vercel.json` is configured correctly
- Verify all dependencies are installed

**"Page not found" on GitHub Pages:**
- Make sure you're using the `gh-pages` branch
- Check that the build output is in the `dist` folder

## 📱 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these features:
- ✅ Login/Signup functionality
- ✅ AI chat (with or without API key)
- ✅ All pages load correctly
- ✅ Responsive design on mobile
- ✅ Dark/light theme toggle

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### For Production:
1. **API Keys**: Don't commit API keys to your repository
2. **Environment Variables**: Use platform-specific env var systems
3. **HTTPS**: All major platforms provide HTTPS by default
4. **CORS**: Configure if you add backend services later

### Best Practices:
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Enable automatic security updates
- Monitor your deployment logs
- Set up custom domains for professionalism

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### Already Included:
- ✅ Vite for fast builds
- ✅ Code splitting
